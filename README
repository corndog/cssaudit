This is a program that crawls your/a website and reports on the usage or lack thereof of the css rules in your stylesheets.
The approach, and some code is taken from the helium-css project, except that instead of adding the necessary javascript to your app this uses phantom.js to load the page(s) and then runs the css analysis.

run it via instructions in the main program, cssaudit.js

if phantom doesn't crash, which it often does (worth trying a few times if its just a random crash), 
it will dump its data in data/data.js
then open up a browser and open pages/stylesheets.html
that will show you a link of the css sheets it found. Click one and you'll see all the
groups of selectors, red ones are not used, orange used once, green twice up to violet used 6 times :)

This is very much work in progress.
